When we want to display numbers within a specific text file, we add the **-N** between less and the file we want to see with number lines. This display of line numbers is usefule for code reviews when needed, or paired programming to locate specific issues easier.

### Example 2: Searching Within Text
To search within text, we only input a back slash "/" and place a specific word or phrase to find within the page. The searching phrase is displayed a the bottom line of the display.Then we press **Enter** to confirm that we are searching for that specific word or phrase. This is helpful when we are trying to find a specific  part of the paragraph. We also need to know that by default, searching in the **less** is case-sensitive. We can ignore the case sensitivity by pressing the **I** key within **less**.

We see more informtion about the file and its location. We see how many files there are and in which file we are in. We also see the percentage we are currently are throught the readings. This is very useful to have when we are reading a text within the file and how far we need to read to complete one file. We can also go to the next file when we input :n when we are finished with the first file.
